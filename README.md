# Machine Explanations Human Studies Literature Survey

- This repository provides **a summarization of recent empirical studies/human studies that measure human understanding with machine explanations** in human-AI interactions.
- We focused on **quantative measures**. Based on our survey, we idenfied three key concepts for measuring human understanding in human-AI decision making: model decision boundary (g), model error (z), and task decision boundary (f). A short description of those three concepts are in the end. 
- In the table, we show the title, AI models used, whether the model predictions were shown or hidden from participants, explanations, and if the study measured any aspects of g, z, or f. ✔️ (or ✖️) indicates that a study measures (or does not measure) a specific aspect of human understanding.
- Papers are organized chronologically, with the most recent studies listed first. 


- Check our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04092) for more details:sunglasses:! Based on the survey, we proposed a cool theoretical framework to describe the relationship between machine explanations and human understanding, which could be helpful for future works.

## Three Core Concepts for Measuring Human Understanding
<img src="https://github.com/Chacha-Chen/Explanations-Human-Studies/blob/main/three-core-concepts.png" width="400">

- We use a two-dimensional binary classification problem to illustrate the three concepts. 
- Task decision boundary, as represented by the dashed line, defines the mapping from inputs to ground-truth labels: inputs on the left are positive and the ones on the right are negative. 
- Model decision boundary, as represented by the solid line, determines model predictions. 
- Model error, the yellow highlighted background between the two boundaries is where the model makes mistakes.
